# Simulating-A-MIPS-Processor-In-C
The goal for this project was to simulate a MIPS processor in C. A text file with sample MIPS code is passed into the program and then executed as if our program was a MIPS processor. Each line in the file is an instruction in MIPS which is stored as a 32 bit unsigned integer. An array was used to keep track of space in memory of the instructions.
